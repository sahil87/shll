# cli/install

`shll install` — installs every roster tool that isn't already installed via Homebrew. Idempotent; safe to re-run.

Source: `src/cmd/shll/install.go`, with shared brew helpers in `src/cmd/shll/brew.go`.

## Behavior contract

The full happy/unhappy paths, in the order `runInstall` evaluates them (`src/cmd/shll/install.go`):

1. **Brew missing.** If `hasBrew(ctx)` returns false, write `brewMissingHint` to stderr and return `errSilent`. Exit code: 1. The hint string is shared with `shll update` (`src/cmd/shll/brew.go:15`).

2. **Partition the roster.** Iterate `Roster` in order, calling `isInstalled(ctx, t.Formula)`; collect the *missing* entries into a local `missing` slice.

3. **Nothing missing → short-circuit.** If `len(missing) == 0`, write `All sahil87 tools already installed.` to stdout and return nil. Exit code: 0. No `brew update` is invoked — there's nothing to install.

4. **No `brew update --quiet`.** Unlike `shll update`, `shll install` does NOT refresh brew metadata first. `brew install sahil87/tap/<formula>` resolves the formula via the tap directly, and the spec freezes this distinction (Design Decision: install ≠ update). `TestInstall_NoBrewUpdateInvoked` pins the contract.

5. **Sequential per-tool install.** For each missing tool in roster order, run `proc.RunForeground(ctx, "brew", "install", t.Formula)`. Best-effort across the roster: on per-tool failure (transport error or non-zero exit), set `anyFailed = true` and `continue` — never abort the loop. After the loop, if `anyFailed`, return `errSilent` (exit 1); else return nil (exit 0).

## Exit codes

| Condition | Exit code |
|-----------|-----------|
| All installs succeeded (or all-already-installed branch) | 0 |
| `brew` not on PATH | 1 (via `errSilent`, hint already on stderr) |
| Any per-tool `brew install` failed | 1 (via `errSilent`, after all missing tools attempted) |

## Constitution VII justification

> *Why a new top-level subcommand?* `install` is a distinct lifecycle operation from `update`: different precondition (tool not installed vs. installed), different failure modes (no metadata-refresh dependency), and different discoverability (a new user wanting "get me the toolkit" looks for `install`). Cannot be cleanly expressed as a flag on `update` because `update`'s installed-only precondition would have to invert for a subset of the run.
>
> *Rejected*: `shll update --install-missing`. The branching gets messy and the verb mismatch hurts new-user discoverability.

## Spec-locked Design Decisions for this subcommand

### #1 Skip-already-installed semantics (not re-install)

> *Why*: Idempotent re-runs are the common case for bootstrap — a user runs `shll install`, installs four tools, then later adds two more to the roster (after a shll release). The second `shll install` should pick up only the new ones. Re-installing what's already present is wasted I/O and noise.
> *Rejected*: `--force` flag for re-install. YAGNI for v0.1.0; users can `brew reinstall sahil87/tap/<formula>` directly when they want it.

### #2 No metadata refresh

> *Why*: `brew install` resolves the formula via the tap directly without needing `brew update --quiet`. Skipping it is faster and the distinction from `shll update` is the point — install and update are separate lifecycle operations.
> *Rejected*: running `brew update --quiet` for "freshness". `shll install` is not a brew metadata refresh tool — users who want a refresh have `brew update` directly, or `shll update` for the combined flow.

### #3 Best-effort across the roster

> *Why*: Mirrors `shll update`'s loop semantics (Constitution V — Graceful Degradation). One failed install (e.g. a tap-side transient error) shouldn't block the rest. The user gets exit 1 with a stderr line per failure and can retry.
> *Rejected*: abort-on-first-failure. Less useful, and inconsistent with `update`.

## Test seam

All `install_test.go` tests inject a fake via `proc.Runner` (`installFakeRunner` t.Cleanup helper, shared with `update_test.go`). No real brew subprocess is ever spawned.

Covered scenarios (`src/cmd/shll/install_test.go`):

- `TestInstall_BrewMissing` — `proc.Run("brew", "--version")` returns `ErrNotFound` → stderr hint, exit 1, no install attempted.
- `TestInstall_AllAlreadyInstalled` — every `brew list` succeeds → stdout `"All sahil87 tools already installed."`, no install calls, exit 0.
- `TestInstall_NoneInstalled` — every `brew list` exit-1 → install all six roster tools, exit 0.
- `TestInstall_PartialInstalled` — only `hop` and `wt` installed → install the other four, skip hop/wt, no stderr.
- `TestInstall_NoBrewUpdateInvoked` — pin the no-metadata-refresh contract: `brew update --quiet` MUST NOT appear in the recorded calls.
- `TestInstall_OneInstallFails` — first roster install (fab-kit) exits non-zero → loop continues through all six, exit 1.
